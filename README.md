# Accident-Detection-system-with-Gps-and-Gsm-System
Project about to use automation module for the real time accident detection with Gps and messiging to Counter part.


Project Objectives
In line with the discussed scope and statement, this project is primarily geared towards the following specific objectives that would define functional success as far as the efforts to curb accident rates are concerned. These objectives are deliberately skewed towards prevention of accidents rather than detection and notification, although the latter are also crucial components of a holistic approach ensuring road safety through auto-navigation and object evasion.

1.	To use accelerometers to detect sudden changes in vehicle motion, which may indicate a potential road accident.

2.	To design a GPS, GSM-driven automobile counter to traditional navigation vehicle navigation.
3.	To implement an Arduino-based GSM, GPS-driven automobile in code in response to the existing vehicle navigation challenges leading to road carnages.
4.	To simulate a GSM, GPS-driven navigation for object evasion and braking vehicle system for accident prevention.
